Climate Analysis and Flask API ReadMe

Congratulations on deciding to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To assist with your trip planning, you've chosen to conduct a climate analysis of the area. The following sections outline the steps I used to accomplish this task.

Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, I utilized Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database provided.

Part 2: Design a query to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data. I used the following steps:
Filter by the station that has the greatest number of observations.
Query the previous 12 months of TOBS data for that station.
Plot the results as a histogram with bins=12
